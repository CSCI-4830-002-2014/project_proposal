# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project. Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
So I went through some other PR's to see what people were thinking of, and while a lot of them were awesome, I really love how simple, plausible, and useful Dawson's idea would be. I was originally thinking about the same sort of premise of calculating traffic throughout the day. Making it interactive and fun to get people interested and talking about it is the hard part.

## Interaction | Data Capture
The passive data could be used as either motion or range sensors to track how many people are in the lobby. Noise levels would also be fun to play around with since we could hang these from the rafters. As for the data that people could interact with, I'm not entirely sure yet. Project Pie (on The Hill) does a neat thing where they have an iPad mounted to the wall that you can snap a picture of yourself at and it automatically uploads to their Instagram page and cycles through all the images as people walk by. It would be fun for people to somehow track how often they are in the lobby, what time of day they seem to prefer, etc. Again, not sure how to do this yet.

## Vizualization
Possibly have a floor layout of the ATLAS lobby and use colors and other visualizations to aggregate data about when it is most active, noise levels, open seats, etc.

## Milestones
Set up sensors and machines around the lobby and in the rafters, along with any interactive systems we use as well. Collect data and figure out a neat way to display it on the big screen throughout the day. Keep data over the next few days/weeks and show statistics. The main goal is what Dawson brought up: find a way to show what days of the week and what time of day the lobby is most busy so that people can schedule their studying around that.

## Necessary Tools
Sound sensors
Range sensors
Arduinos
D3 and JavaScript
Access to the big screen in the lobby
