# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description

I think a cool project to put in the ATLAS Lobby would be sensors that senses both heat and noise, and using that data creates a cool, colored display that show the overall "mood" of the room. I call it "Zeitgeist."

## Interaction | Data Capture
The data would be collected passively via sound and heat sensors set up in ATLAS. The data would be collected once a second hereabouts. 

## Vizualization

To the left, there would be two line-graphs: one based on sound and one based on heat signature. Both will vascillate between red and blue color ranges. To the right, it has a label that says "Mood of the room", and then it displays the mood based on thresholds of heat and sound. 

## Milestones
 
 We would need to:

 1). Figure out what technology we need for sensors and how the data is comming in.
 2). Decide what the range of moods we want to measure and set the thresholds for each mood. 
 4). Set up the sensors.
 5). Clean Data
 6). Create the code for visulaizations and thresholds.
 7). Test project.

## Necessary Tools

Javascript, CSS, HTML, heat sensors, sound sensors
