# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
Count the number of people currently inside the building.

## Interaction | Data Capture
We would attach two motion sensors on each entrance to determine if people are exiting or entering.

## Vizualization
There are many things we can do with the data specially after we collect for a while. A very basic thing we can do is to have a bar chart with time on x-axis and number of people inside the builder on y-axis. (time could be in hour)

## Milestones
[Give a rough flow for your project.  Explain the steps that would be involved to move from idea to completed implementation.]
1. We first need to get our hardware which would be sensors (Arduino).
2. Then we need to write a program for our arduino that uses the sensor and sends the data to an external source.
3. We need to have a receiver that gets information from all sensors, stores the info and process them. (Determine if a person has entered/exited)

## Necessary Tools
[What programming languages, sensors, hardware, etc, are necessary to finish your project]
Arduino Motion Sensor, Bluetooth(or wifi chip for arduino, to be researched), C++

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
