# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
I was thinking an accidentally interactive display would be fun. Have some physical item, such as a box, with three different buttons on it, made to look aesthetically pleasing. When a user presses a button a random event occurs on screen. There picture gets taken, record 5 seconds of audio, ask them to answer a question by using the buttons, ect. Have that event display something on the screen, and then take that event and add it to a data set of continuous visualizations that lives on the screen most of the time - not really sure what these would be. 

## Interaction | Data Capture
See above

## Vizualization
Present some "reward/response" for the event when the user participates, but at all non-participation times have the data collected by participation visualized in some way. Maybe am mosaic of the random pictures taken, or sound visualizations/bad captioning of recorded audio events. 

## Milestones
Assign teams to:
Design Box,
Design "Participation activities",
Design "Big Data" visualizations

The teams would each be responsible for well defined inputs/outputs so work could occur concurrently. Maybe if time was left create some API to let other interested parties create events or visualizations. 

## Necessary Tools
Materials for aesthetically pleasing box. 
Ardino or Raspberry Pi
Microphone, Camera, possibly other interesting sensors

Most likely node and d3 for visualizations, activities would by either node, Ruby, Python, or whatever really. 



## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
