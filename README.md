# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
The project would prompt the user to perform some action, or express some emotion based on how they feel. Then the user would perform their interpretation of the question (possibly something like, 'How do you feel today?') and the data would be read and stored. Based on how they interact-say they feel sad and make a sad face-interface will create an art visualization reflecting that. This could also mean a small portion of a much bigger art visualization. 

## Interaction | Data Capture
A button could be pushed to alert the system that some data will to be collected. A camera would be used to record the actual data itself and some sort of processor/storage device would be used to interpret/store the data. A rasberri pi + camera could work, or a kinect and some other PC (not sure what a kinect requires). Code would need to be written for either case, or we'd have to borrow some APIs.

## Vizualization
As more data is collected, a progressively larger art piece will be drawn/painted. This could be predetermined and the only variation is the color based on the user input, or we could do something more unique and exciting, like a weird tree or landscape.

## Milestones
1. Spend some time with some APIs/code and draw out exactly how long it will take to implement this idea. Figure out what is going to be possible in this short time frame.
2. Figure out budgeting and costs. Are there cheaper/smarter alternatives to this idea? 
3. Aquire hardware and create the planned set up. Figure out how to hide the devices to eliminate user interference. 
4. Create some interface and do some testing. Record feedback and fix things according to the feedback.
5. Implement the project on a small scale, with a small art piece and data collection size.
6. Set up in ATLAS.
7. Party hard.

## Necessary Tools
Camera, low end computer/storage device, some external APIs, C# (kinect), C, C++ (OpenGL if 3d), javascript, maybe python.

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
