# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
Sound visualization. Show the loudest hours so students are able to pick the quietest study hours.

## Interaction | Data Capture
Arduino sound sensor given in class

## Vizualization
Potentially opportunity for two cool images at once. One more "old-school" graph that shows the loudest time of day and loudest day of the week. Another immediatly responsive image of a sin-wave which increases in amplitude the louder it gets.

## Milestones
1. Sound sensor with immediate feedback accurate
2. Graph the loudest sounds per time unit (Begin with seconds, then larger and larger increments until 1 day bins is accurate) on a bar or something fun chart
3. Have sin-wave animation functioning
4. Change the amplitude of the wave based upon highest voltage reading over a time period (ex. Largest voltage reading per second)

## Necessary Tools
Sound sensor
Arduino
Immediate feedback stuff (Cables, wifi, bluetooth, whatever the best method is )
d3 and JS
