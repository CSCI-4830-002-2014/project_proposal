# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
The volume and style of music will vary depending on how busy and populated the lobby is.

## Interaction | Data Capture
It would use audio sensors to determine how busy the lobby is

## Vizualization
Open to ideas for this one, the initial part of this project only effects audio.

## Milestones
using several audio sensors throughout the lobby, they would provide the average sound level over a predetermined interval.  Once this level passes a certain thresh hold, it will change to a list of music more upbeat or slowed down depending on how busy the room is.

## Necessary Tools
several sound sensors would be needed.

## Supporting Images
