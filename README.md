# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
I would love to see a heat sensing display that will detect body heat signatures from students passing by. Data would be retrieved from thermal sensors (wasn't really sure if anything I found was useful to doing this) and implemented with live feed video monitoring so the display is attractive to passer-bys. With this people can identify and see exactly how warm their skin temperature is through detection. A sweaty individual and sitting individual will both have different reads and colors of the skin. 

## Interaction | Data Capture
Like I stated above, we could use an infrared/thermal camera with a live feed that is wired to monitors that change as you walk by them. Also, infrared sensors could be attached to a whole section of a wall and we could incorporate enough LEDs or other lights to make out body shapes and different colors for body temperature. For example, if someone walked by this the infrared monitors would detect heat signals, record data very quickly, and output it onto the LED wall to show a basic heat index of the heat coming off of your body.

## Vizualization
An LED wall like stated above would be cool. Televisions, projectors, or a kind of monitor would be useful for this project too. 

## Milestones
-Choose between live feed video or thermal/infrared sensors for this project
-Buy infrared/ thermal sensors or surveillance materials for full hallway detection
-Implement a code that ties all materials together
- If choosing the LED wall, buy drivers and LED Matrices to simplify creating panel detection
    - By this, I mean that we do not have to hard-code every LED on a wall because that would be horrible
-Prototype Testing 
-Find possible bugs, glitches, interferences with prototype after initial tests go well
-Polish up the project
-Live test in ATLAS to see if the project piece works
-Finalize all parts of project if second test goes well
-If all goes well, finish and put in ATLAS


## Necessary Tools
[What programming languages, sensors, hardware, etc, are necessary to finish your project]
Arduinos are very useful for driving information like this, but this would be too large scale for us to use just one. Arduino, Python, or C++ would be the most useful languages in my opinion. 

Materials possibly needed: Heat/thermal sensors or infrared sensors, infrared camera, infrared security cameras, LED Matrices (a lot of them), Drivers for the matrix, Arduinos or something that can incorporate large amounts of matrices attached to it, wire, solder.

Hardware/etc: An encoding program for our constant heat recording sensors/cameras, database for recorded information(cloud environment maybe?), material to mount final project to wall, a tool that will mold all of the Matrix boards together in the end.

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
