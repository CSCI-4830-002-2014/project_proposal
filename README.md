# Final Project Proposal -- Jake White

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
[Give a broad description of the project you'd like to see implanted in the ATLAS Lobby -- flame throwing pumpkin http://www.instructables.com/id/Flamethrowing-Jack-O-Lantern/?ALLSTEPS, log data analyzing an increase or decrease of people entering the room given new awesome feature]

## Interaction | Data Capture
[Explain what would drive your installation - i.e., how would the user interact and feed it data or how would it collect data passively. -- The user would get to pull the trigger on a transmitter and watch a pumpkin spit flames. We would record with another arduino the amount of people entering (and exiting) a room - monitoring traffic ]

## Vizualization
[How would we present this data on the screens in the lobby? -- could graph the amount of traffic in the room throughout the day, which is fairly interesting in itself]

## Milestones
[Give a rough flow for your project.  Explain the steps that would be involved to move from idea to completed implementation. a fair amount of work has to be put into setting up the flame throwing pumpkin - not familiar with how the transmitter and receiver work so that is something to take into account. Also have no experience with the pressure plate sensor, so that is another obstical that would have to be taken into account, but seems very cool]

## Necessary Tools
[pressure plate mechanism http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ih685nyYWoI&feature=youtu.be, http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,145373.0.html, a couple ardunios, wd40, SquidBee transmitter and receiver, perfboard, a roped off area]
