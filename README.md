# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
For my project idea you would basically have an array of sound sensors placed stratigically throughout the atlas lobby and then for the visualization on the screen you would show a map of the lobby and the corresponding sound levels in each sector.

## Interaction | Data Capture
It would collect data passivley throughout the lobby and feed it to some sort of web server.

## Vizualization
It would be presented as a map of the lobby and the sound level overlayed for all the locations

## Milestones
1. Get an array of sound sensors to submit their data to a central location.
2. Clean the data and prepare it for visualization
3. Display data on map in the correct location for that sensor.

## Necessary Tools
Sounds Sensors, Web Server, A way for the remote sensors to send data to the central server, Visualization tech.

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
