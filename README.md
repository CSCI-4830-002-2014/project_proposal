# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
I would love to see a motion detector that caught your movements and showed like stick figures of your body moving with you along the wall/projector. It would be like a mirror except you would be looking at a moving stick figure.

## Interaction | Data Capture
So the data we would be collecting would be like the movements of each dot as you walk past the sensor and how often you move within a certain area. So we would collect data-points and see how many moving parts can occur within the (insert how long the project will stay in the lobby.)

## Vizualization
A moving stick figure that moves with your body. Almost like a mirror except a stick figure.

## Milestones
So we would need to be able to collect the hardware, code the data collection, code the "mirror" stick figure, then be able to code the visualization, and finally test out what we have before implementing it.

## Necessary Tools
[What programming languages, sensors, hardware, etc, are necessary to finish your project]

We would need a motion sensor, the hardware (Im sure sparkware has something), and i would assume we would need an easier language to code in considering this is a bigger project (so maybe Python?)

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
