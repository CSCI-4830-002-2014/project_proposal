# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
A Andy Warhol style popart image that would change color and intensity based on the loudness and motion of the room

## Interaction | Data Capture
It would collect data just by sound and by motion sensing. Users could interact by moving around or being louder

## Vizualization
The art-style image would become brighter and change color.

## Milestones
1. Create Art Pop Art. (Possibly of something CU related or tech related. Steve Jobs or Woz maybe?)
2. Create motion sensing and sound sensing arduino.
3. Write program to translate intensity into color brightness and color on the screen image

## Necessary Tools
Arduino, and I'm guessing I could write the image modifier in a lot of different programming languages.

## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
