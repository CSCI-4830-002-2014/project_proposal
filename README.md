# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
Facial recognition of students walking through. A face detection library assigns each face as happy or sad. The screen displays one of many images of a smiley face that most represents the averge emotion and stats comparing it to other days. It also displays a forecast based on results from previous days of the week/hours of the day.

## Interaction | Data Capture
A camera in the room would collect face data as people walked through. The images would not be stored; just the values.

## Vizualization
Use of D3 charts for predictions/past performance as well as smiley face images displayed by logic from the data. 

## Milestones

1. Learn how to use opencv to grab camera data. Test with webcams/local cameras
2. Implement a database where the camera data can live
3. Write simple queries to begin working with the data
4. Incorporate predictive algorithms
5. Write D3/javascript code to display the data
6. Install cameras in Atlas
7. Launch

## Necessary Tools
[What programming languages, sensors, hardware, etc, are necessary to finish your project]
We would likely need multiple sensors with mounts as well as space for the projector. The face detection could occur with opencv
http://docs.opencv.org/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html (supports python, c, c++).
