# Final Project Proposal

Use this template to submit your project proposal and we will vote on them next week to decide 4 to implement in the final project.  Remember this project will be a single feature in a multi-feature exhibit for the ATLAS Lobby.

## Description
A simple picture with lots of people and using motion sensors, the eyes of all the people follow you around where ever you stand. Everyone can wave goodbye once the motion sensor doesnâ€™t register anyone there anymore. Got inspiration from the living pictures in Hogwarts (Harry Potter).

## Interaction | Data Capture
The user would walk around and interact with the motion sensor right next to the screen.

## Vizualization
The movement of the eyes and the actions of the people would represent the data from the motion sensor.

## Milestones
Find a good picture and customize the eyes so they can be changed where they are looking. Set up a motion sensor and make it so it is in line with the eyes. Design it so the graphics response to movement.

## Necessary Tools
Motion sensor, some sort of graphic/picture editing tool.


## Supporting Images
[NOT REQUIRED FOR SUBMISSION.  Use this space to add any drawings, pictures, or supporting material that clarifies or exemplifies what you're project would look like or how the visualization would be designed.]
